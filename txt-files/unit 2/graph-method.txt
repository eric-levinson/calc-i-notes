Consider the graph of some function y=f(x)


graph here --- see img graph-method-1.png


Evaluate limit as x rightwards arrow short dash 1 of f left parenthesis x right parenthesis, limit as x rightwards arrow 4 of f left parenthesis x right parenthesis, and limit as x rightwards arrow 7 of f left parenthesis x right parenthesis. 


------


limit as x rightwards arrow short dash 1 of f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals 8
limit as x rightwards arrow 4 of f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals 3
limit as x rightwards arrow 7 of f left parenthesis x right parenthesis space d o e s space n o t space e x i s t

RATIONALE
As x gets closer to -1, f left parenthesis x right parenthesis gets closer to 8.

As x gets closer to 4, f left parenthesis x right parenthesis gets closer to 3. Note that the actual value of f left parenthesis 4 right parenthesis is -3 (closed dot at x equals 4), but the limit tells us what is happening as we get closer and closer to 4, not what is happening right at 4.

As x gets closer to 7 from the left (values smaller than 7), f left parenthesis x right parenthesis gets closer to 13.5. However, as x gets closer to 7 from the right (values larger than 7), f left parenthesis x right parenthesis gets closer to 6.

Since f left parenthesis x right parenthesis approaches two different values as x approaches 7, we say the limit does not exist.
