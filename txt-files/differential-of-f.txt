Calculate the differential of a function using derivatives.

  
Let y=ln(3x^4+6x^2+2)

Find the differential, dy.

Choose from the following:


a.)
d y equals fraction numerator 12 x cubed plus 12 x over denominator 3 x to the power of 4 plus 6 x squared plus 2 end fraction d x

b.)
d y equals fraction numerator 1 over denominator 3 x to the power of 4 plus 6 x squared plus 2 end fraction d x

c.)
d y equals fraction numerator 1 over denominator 3 x to the power of 4 plus 6 x squared plus 2 end fraction

d.)
d y equals fraction numerator 12 x cubed plus 12 x over denominator 3 x to the power of 4 plus 6 x squared plus 2 end fraction
The differential of a function is defined as the derivative of the function multiplied by the differential of the variable.

In this case, the function is y = ln(3x^4 + 6x^2 + 2), and the variable is x. The differential of the variable is dx.

To find the differential of the function, we first need to find the derivative of the function. The derivative of the function y = ln(u) with respect to x is given by:

y' = 1/u * u'

where u is a function of x.

Substituting the expression for y into this formula, we get:

y' = 1/(3x^4 + 6x^2 + 2) * (12x^3 + 12x)

This simplifies to:

y' = (12x^3 + 12x) / (3x^4 + 6x^2 + 2)

Therefore, the differential of the function is:

dy = y' * dx = (12x^3 + 12x) / (3x^4 + 6x^2 + 2) * dx

The differential dy is the derivative of the function multiplied by the differential of the variable.

Therefore, the answer is (a) dy = (12x^
