firstly get the average of the integral

symbolab: function average {f(x)= whatever}, 0, 3

then get the average of the derivative
function\:average\:f\left(x\right)=2x^2+1,\:0,\:3

Take that average value and plug it in to simplify
2c^2+1=7

keep in mind there could be MULTIPLE answer that get combined on the exam

eg c= sqrt(-3), c= sqrt(3)

and they would call that Sqrt(+-3) or some shit like that
