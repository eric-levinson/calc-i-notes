Find the second derivative of y equals 6 x cos x.

Choose from  the following:

a.)
fraction numerator d squared y over denominator d x squared end fraction equals short dash 12 sin x plus 6 x cos x

b.)
fraction numerator d squared y over denominator d x squared end fraction equals short dash 6 cos x

c.)
fraction numerator d squared y over denominator d x squared end fraction equals 6 cos x

d.)
fraction numerator d squared y over denominator d x squared end fraction equals short dash 12 sin x minus 6 x cos x
To find the second derivative of the function y = 6xcos(x), we can use the chain rule.

-------------------------------------

The first derivative of y is given by:

y' = 6cos(x) - 6xsin(x)

The second derivative of y is given by:

y'' = -12sin(x) - 6xcos(x)

So the correct answer is:

y'' = -12 sin x minus 6 x cos x

Therefore, the correct answer is (d).
