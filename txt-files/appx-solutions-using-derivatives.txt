Approximate the solutions of equations by using derivatives (Newton’s method).

  
Write Newton’s formula used to approximate a solution of the equation x cubed minus x minus 20 equals 0 and find the third iteration value. Be sure to verify both parts of the answer are correct when making your selection.

Newton's method is a method for approximating the solutions of an equation by using derivatives. It is based on the idea that if a function f(x) has a root (i.e. a value of x that makes the function equal to 0), then the tangent line to the function at that root will have a slope equal to the derivative of the function at that point.

Newton's formula for approximating a solution of the equation f(x) = 0 is given by:

x_n+1 = x_n - f(x_n) / f'(x_n)

where x_n is the nth approximation of the root, and f'(x_n) is the derivative of the function at x_n.

In this case, the equation is x^3 - x - 20 = 0, and we want to find the third iteration value.

The first iteration value is x_1 = 3 (an initial guess).

The second iteration value is x_2 = x_1 - f(x_1) / f'(x_1) = 3 - (3^3 - 3 - 20) / (3^2 - 1) = 3 - (-20) / 8 = 3 + 2.5 = 5.5

The third iteration value is x_3 = x_2 - f(x_2) / f'(x_2) = 5.5 - (5.5^3 - 5.5 - 20) / (5.5^2 - 1) = 5.5 - (-17.5) / 30.25 = 5.5 + 0.58 = 6.08

Therefore, the third iteration value is x_3 = 6.08.

The correct answer is (a) x_n+1 = x_n - f(
