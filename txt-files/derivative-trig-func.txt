To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 7x^3 sec(x), we can use the chain rule. The chain rule states that if f(x) = g(h(x)), then f'(x) = g'(h(x)) * h'(x).

In this case, we can let g(x) = x^3 and h(x) = sec(x). The derivative of g(x) is g'(x) = 3x^2, and the derivative of h(x) is h'(x) = sec(x)tan(x).

Substituting these values into the chain rule, we get:

f'(x) = 3x^2 * sec(x)tan(x)

This simplifies to:

f'(x) = 21x^2 sec(x)tan(x)

So the correct answer is:

f'(x) = 21 x squared sec x tan x

Therefore, the correct answer is (a).





a.)Incorrect.
It is important to remember to use the product rule when differentiating the product of two functions.

d.)Correct.
This is the product of two functions, so the product rule will be used: 

f apostrophe left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals D left square bracket 7 x cubed right square bracket times sec x plus 7 x cubed times D left square bracket sec x right square bracket

Recall D left square bracket 7 x cubed right square bracket equals 21 x squared, D left square bracket sec x right square bracket equals sec x tan x: 

f apostrophe left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals 21 x squared times sec x plus 7 x cubed times sec x tan x

Eliminate unnecessary symbols: 

f apostrophe left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals 21 x squared sec x plus 7 x cubed sec x tan x
I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. You are correct that the correct answer is (d).

f'(x) = 21 x squared sec x plus 7 x cubed sec x tan x

This is the derivative of the function f(x) = 7x^3 sec(x) using the product rule.

Thank you for pointing out the error in my previous response. I apologize for any confusion that may have caused. Please let me know if you have any further questions.





Try again

Compute derivatives that combine tanx/cotx/cscx/secx with past rules.

  
Find the derivative of y equals 5 x to the power of 6 plus 7 over x to the power of 4 minus 3 tan x.

Choose from the following

a.)
y apostrophe equals 30 x to the power of 5 minus 28 over x to the power of 5 minus 3 sec squared x

b.)
y apostrophe equals 30 x to the power of 5 minus 28 over x to the power of 5 minus 3 sec x

c.)
y apostrophe equals 30 x to the power of 5 minus 28 over x cubed minus 3 sec squared x

d.)
y apostrophe equals 30 x to the power of 5 minus fraction numerator 7 over denominator 4 x cubed end fraction minus 3 sec squared x
To find the derivative of the function y = (5x^6 + 7)/(x^4 - 3tan(x)), we can use the quotient rule. The quotient rule states that if f(x) = (g(x))/(h(x)), then f'(x) = (g'(x)h(x) - g(x)h'(x))/h(x)^2.

In this case, we can let g(x) = 5x^6 + 7 and h(x) = x^4 - 3tan(x). The derivatives of these functions are g'(x) = 30x^5 and h'(x) = -3sec^2(x). Plugging these values into the formula above, we get:

y' = [(30x^5 * (x^4 - 3tan(x)) - (5x^6 + 7) * (-3sec^2(x))] / (x^4 - 3tan(x))^2

This simplifies to:

y' = (30x^9 - 15x^7sec^2(x)) / (x^4 - 3tan(x))^2

So the correct answer is:

y' = 30 x to the power of 5 minus 28 over x to the power of 5 minus 3 sec squared x

Therefore, the correct answer is (a).
