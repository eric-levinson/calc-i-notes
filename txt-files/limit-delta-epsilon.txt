Consider the following limit statement:

limit as x rightwards arrow 3 of left parenthesis 4 x minus 7 right parenthesis equals 5

Find the corresponding value of delta when epsilon equals 0.005.

RATIONALE
If epsilon equals 0.005, this means we want open vertical bar 4 x minus 7 minus 5 close vertical bar less than 0.005.

Simplify:

open vertical bar 4 x minus 12 close vertical bar less than 0.005

open vertical bar x close vertical bar less than a means short dash a less than x less than a, so we can say: 

short dash 0.005 less than 4 x minus 12 less than 0.005

Add 12 to all three parts: 

11.995 less than 4 x less than 12.005

Divide all three parts by 4: 

2.99875 less than x less than 3.00125

Subtract 3 from all three parts to get x minus 3 in the middle: 

short dash 0.00125 less than x minus 3 less than 0.00125

Thus, delta equals 0.00125.

Gets you most of the way there, but you have to do some simplifying to get the final answer.
