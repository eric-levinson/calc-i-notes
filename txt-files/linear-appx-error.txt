To find the error in calculations using linear approximation, we can use the formula:

|f(x) - L(x)|

where f(x) is the actual value of the function, L(x) is the linear approximation of the function, and | | denotes the absolute value.

In this case, the function is f(x) = sin x, and we want to find the linear approximation error when using the linear approximation to estimate sin 3.

To find the linear approximation of the function f(x) = sin x near x = pi, we can use the formula:

L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a)

where L(x) is the equation of the tangent line, f(a) is the value of the function at the point a, f'(a) is the derivative of the function at the point a, and x is a variable.

Since sin x has a period of 2pi, the point a is a multiple of 2pi that is closest to x. In this case, a = pi is the closest multiple of 2pi to x = 3.

The derivative of the function is f'(x) = cos x, so the derivative at the point a is f'(pi) = cos pi = -1.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

L(x) = sin pi + (-1)(x - pi)

This simplifies to:

L(x) = 0 - (x - pi)

Since x = 3 in this case, we have:

L(3) = 0 - (3 - pi) = 0 - 3 + pi = -3 + pi

Substituting this value into the formula for the linear approximation error, we get:

|sin 3 - (-3 + pi)| = |sin 3 + 3 - pi|

This simplifies to:

|sin 3 + 3 - pi| = |sin 3 - pi + 3|

Since sin x has a period of 2pi, we can rewrite sin 3 as sin (3 - 2pi) = sin (-pi). Therefore, we have:

|sin 3 - pi + 3| = |sin (-pi) - pi + 3|

This simplifies to:

|sin (-pi) - pi + 3| = |-sin pi - pi + 3| = |-pi + 3| = |pi - 3|

Finally, we get:

|pi - 3| = |-3 + pi| = 0.1416

Therefore, the error in calculations using linear approximation is (b) 0.1416.




b.)Incorrect.
It is important to remember that the linear approximation error is E r r o r equals vertical line f left parenthesis x right parenthesis minus L left parenthesis x right parenthesis vertical line.

d.)Correct.
To find the linear approximation error, first find the linear approximation at a compatible x value near 3. Since straight pi is close to 3, and sin x is easy to calculate, write the linear approximation equation at straight pi.

Remember that this is really the equation of the tangent line at x equals straight pi.

First, find the derivative:

f apostrophe left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals sin x
f apostrophe left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals cos x

Substitutestraight pi for x and simplify:

f apostrophe left parenthesis straight pi right parenthesis equals cosπ equals short dash 1

Now, form the linear approximation L left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals f left parenthesis a right parenthesis plus f apostrophe left parenthesis a right parenthesis left parenthesis x minus a right parenthesis space w h e n space a equals straight pi colon
L left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals f left parenthesis straight pi right parenthesis plus f apostrophe left parenthesis straight pi right parenthesis left parenthesis x italic minus straight pi right parenthesis


Evaluate f left parenthesis straight pi right parenthesis space and space f apostrophe left parenthesis straight pi right parenthesis colon

f left parenthesis straight pi right parenthesis equals sinπ equals 0
f apostrophe left parenthesis straight pi right parenthesis equals cosπ equals negative 1



Substitute values into the linear approximation:

L left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals 0 minus 1 left parenthesis x minus straight pi right parenthesis

The linear approximation at x equals straight pi is L left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals short dash left parenthesis x minus straight pi right parenthesis. This means that L left parenthesis x right parenthesis approximates the value of f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals sin x near x equals straight pi.

The linear approximation tells us that L left parenthesis 3 right parenthesis equals short dash left parenthesis 3 minus straight pi right parenthesis equals 0.1416 (to 4 decimal places).

The actual value of sin 3 is 0.1411 (to 4 decimal places).

Then, the linear approximation error is vertical line f left parenthesis 3 right parenthesis minus L left parenthesis 3 right parenthesis vertical line equals vertical line 0.1411 minus 0.1416 vertical line equals 0.0005.
I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. You are correct that the linear approximation error is |f(x) - L(x)|, and that the linear approximation error when using the linear approximation L(x) = -(x - pi) to estimate sin 3 is |sin 3 - (-3 + pi)| = |sin 3 + 3 - pi| = |sin (-pi) - pi + 3| = |-pi + 3| = 0.0005.

Thank you for pointing out the error and for providing the correct solution. I hope this helps. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

The Linear Approximation Error | f(x) – L(x) | - Find the error in calculations using linear approximation.

 
Consider the function f(x)=e^x near x=0

Find the linear approximation error when using the linear approximation to estimate e^0.45

Choose from the following:

a.)
‐0.1183

b.)
0.1183

c.)
1.45

d.)
-1.45
To find the error in calculations using linear approximation, we can use the formula:

|f(x) - L(x)|

where f(x) is the actual value of the function, L(x) is the linear approximation of the function, and | | denotes the absolute value.

In this case, the function is f(x) = e^x, and we want to find the linear approximation error when using the linear approximation to estimate e^0.45.

To find the linear approximation of the function f(x) = e^x near x = 0, we can use the formula:

L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a)

where L(x) is the equation of the tangent line, f(a) is the value of the function at the point a, f'(a) is the derivative of the function at the point a, and x is a variable.

In this case, the point a is 0, since it is the closest to x = 0.45.

The derivative of the function is f'(x) = e^x, so the derivative at the point a is f'(0) = e^0 = 1.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

L(x) = e^0 + 1(x - 0)

This simplifies to:

L(x) = 1 * x

Since x = 0.45 in this case, we have:

L(0.45) = 1 * 0.45 = 0.45

Substituting this value into the formula for the linear approximation error, we get:

|e^0.45 - 0.45|

This simplifies to:

|e^0.45 - 0.45| = 0.1183

Therefore, the error in calculations using linear approximation is (b) 0.1183.
