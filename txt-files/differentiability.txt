Keeping that in mind

Determine if the function f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals cube root of x is differentiable at x equals short dash 8. If not, identify why.

Choose from the following

a.)
f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals cube root of x is not differentiable at x equals short dash 8 because  limit as x rightwards arrow short dash 8 of cube root of x does not exist.

b.)
f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals cube root of x is not differentiable at x equals short dash 8 because f left parenthesis short dash 8 right parenthesis is not defined.

c.)
f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals cube root of x is differentiable at x equals short dash 8.

d.)
f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals cube root of x is not differentiable at x equals short dash 8 because f apostrophe left parenthesis short dash 8 right parenthesis is not defined.
